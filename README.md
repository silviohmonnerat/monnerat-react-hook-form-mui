# Material-UI, React Hook Form and Yup Validation combined

## About this project

This project simplifies the use of `react-hook-form`, `Material-UI` and `Yup`. It provides opinionated use cases with following components:

- FormContainer
- TextFieldElement
- SelectElement
- MultiSelectElement
- RadioButtonGroup
- CheckboxButtonGroup
- CheckboxElement
- SwitchElement
- PasswordElement
- DatePickerElement

The components are written in TypeScript and attempt an easy integration.

## How to use it

### Installation

```
  yarn react-hook-form monnerat-react-hook-form-mui
```

The dependency of `react-hook-form` is a peerDependency so don't forget to install it as well.

### Important

From versions >= 3.x of this package MUI v5 is in use. Versions of 1 & 2 using Material-UI v4

### Your component code

```
import { FormContainer, TextFieldElement } from 'monnerat-react-hook-form-mui'

function Form(){
  return (
    <FormContainer
      defaultValues={{name: ''}}
      onSuccess={(data) => {console.log(data)}}
    >
      <TextFieldElement name="name" label="Name" required/>
    </FormContainer>
  )
}
```

You can have a look at the `example` folder which sets up NextJS with `monnerat-react-hook-form-mui`

### FormContainer creates `formContext`

The `<FormContainer />` wires up a form and you can create sub-components which either make use
of `useFormContext() | useWatch()` to react to form values.

<!-- ## Demo

Check out Storybook: [Demo](https://react-hook-form-material-ui.vercel.app)

You will find examples and use cases. -->

### With Datepicker

If you are using the `DatepickerElement` keep in mind that you have to wrap your form with a provider:

Examples for Dayjs or DateFns provider (used in the demo):

- [DateFns](/src/DateFnsProvider.tsx)
- [Dayjs](/src/DateFnsProvider.tsx)

### Bundle

This project uses `microbundle` to wrap the package for `npm`.
